# Compiler-LLVM-IR
Final coursework for the module 6CCS3CFL during my time at KCL, where I am required to implement a compiler targeting the LLVM-IR.

Main file: /KevinQuah "cw5.sc"

Input files to be compiled are stored in the "Programs" folder.
Results of compiling are stored in the "KevinQuah" folder ending with ".ll"
